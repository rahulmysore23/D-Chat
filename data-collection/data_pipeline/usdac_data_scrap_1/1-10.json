            "paragraph": "It is best to thaw meat or poultry before putting it into a slow cooker. Frozen pieces will take longer to reach a safe internal temperature and could possibly result in foodborne illness. Frozen or partially frozen foods can also cool everything else in the slow cooker. Taking the lid off the slow cooker to stir or break up thawing foods lowers the temperature of the food and lengthens the cooking time. If using a commercially frozen slow cooker meal, prepare according to manufacturer's instructions. See also Slow Cookers and Food Safety."

Be sure to return any unused portion to the refrigerator within two hours to remain safe.\n\nAfter each reheating, leftovers will be safe in the fridge for an additional three to four days. Because the quality decreases each time food is reheated, it is best to reheat only the amount needed. Cooked foods that cannot be used within four days should be frozen for longer, safe storage. Leftovers are safe in the freezer indefinitely, but they are at best quality for a few months.\n\nFor more information visit, Leftovers and Food Safety ."

A large cut of meat or whole poultry should be divided into smaller pieces and wrapped separately or placed in shallow containers before refrigerating. Cover foods to retain moisture and prevent them from picking up odors from other foods. Except during cooking, food must not be out of the refrigerator for more than two hours."

            "paragraph": "Because freezing keeps food safe almost indefinitely, recommended storage times are for quality (taste and texture) only. Refer to the freezer storage chart at the end of Freezing and Food Safety which lists optimum freezing times for best quality. If a food is not listed on the chart, you may determine its quality after thawing. First check the odor. Some foods will develop a rancid or off odor or freezer burn when frozen too long. Freezer burn doesn't make the food unsafe. Cut it off and use the food. Some may not look picture perfect or be of high enough quality to serve alone but may be edible; use them to make soups or stews."
